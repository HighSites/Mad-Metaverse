# Mad Metaverse
## _My first project_

This is a small, simple landing page. Just basics
But I loved it's simplicity and dark theme

## Template

I found it's [template](https://www.figma.com/file/mR3IXexKjACK3HasDtBrVL/Mad-Metaverse?node-id=2%3A5) somewhere in telegram bot, saved it, and then built it

[![COVER](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HighSites/Mad-Metaverse/main/project/info/cover.jpg)](https://www.figma.com/file/mR3IXexKjACK3HasDtBrVL/Mad-Metaverse?node-id=2%3A5)

This figma file wasn't very convinient to work with: 
 - the main unit is declared as ```8px```, but distance between elements was pretty random. 
 - And this steps, that are located in a circle? Those were fun to made (though I'm not sure I did it optimal)
 - Also, the meaning of elements sometimes was pretty... Confusing
 - _Anyway, I don't like to complain, so lets just say it was fun and challenging)_

## Result
**I'm not satisfyed with the outcome**
 - The file structure and building system have been updated,  
 - I'm not agree with units
 - Unstable svg using
 - And so on...

Regardless I already want to rewrite it, I prefer this project to be a start of my portfolio
(Also, it's my way to answer to extra perfectionism)


 
# ✨So let it begin!✨
